How To Improve Your Life

First, we need to understand how the mind works. It judges things on a scale from the best good to the worst bad, with indifference in the middle. This is a primarily subconscious calculation affected by moods and based on previously learned judgments.

Naturally, we want what’s considered good and don't want the bad. Our wants bring about feelings that motivate us to act. We get upset when our mind sees the current outcome as bad. This dislike of reality is the only cause of our unhappiness, so it’s the one true bad.

Negative feelings can alert us to our dislike of reality. That doesn't always happen, but it becomes more frequent. When the mind is under the influence of negative emotions, it's actually hard to remember that the only reason we're upset is because it dislikes reality. being upset hinders its ability to think clearly and logically, which further compounds our troubles.

Ending our mind’s dislike of reality comes from seeing that everyone has to do whatever seems reasonable, based on their mind’s learned judgments. Every situation had to happen exactly how it happened due to cause and effect. Disliking reality is illogical.

We’re animals. Our mind makes things negative, positive, or indifferent depending upon how they’re judged according to our biology and conditioning.

That's perfectly fine until we don't get what we want. Now, if the mind sees that outcome (reality) as bad, we dislike it, so we’re upset, and our thinking is clouded, so the mind makes worse decisions.

Byron Katie’s statement makes sense in this light.
“If you love your story, you love your life.”

It all comes down to being motivated by feelings. To some minds, violence makes sense when someone “caused” them pain, and they believe harming them is justified. 

We will do whatever seems reasonable, according to the mind’s reasons. Those reasons are based on its desires. The mind desires things that it judges as a net positive and desires to avoid negative things.

Epictetus, the Stoic philosopher, says it like this in Discourses 3.3

Every mind will:
- assent to [perceived] truth
- reject [perceived] falsehood
- suspend judgment when uncertain
- gravitate toward [perceived] good
- recoil from [perceived] bad
- be indifferent to what is [perceived] neither

Ultimately, the mind is just aware of the outcome of its programming (biology + conditioning), but it can learn how it works so it can begin to question its judgments that aren’t helpful. The power can still be in the person’s hands because their mind can reason.

Example: The “separate self” approach doesn’t help me with social anxiety. I mean, it does in the sense that it is what it is based on cause and effect, but I still feel uncomfortable if I think I’m awkward.

My mind judges being perceived as awkward as a bad thing. It sees not fitting in as harmful because other desires won’t get fulfilled (e.g., my mind doesn’t want my wife to lose friends because I’m not good socially). I would need to see these things differently, or I’ll continue to suffer with this same mental pattern. (Learning more about social norms and practice makes sense since my mind wants these things.)

I believe these are the various planes Ram Dass discusses, so these pieces may fit together fine, but the solutions people want happen by fixing mental judgments. Would you agree?

- we don’t like the idea of getting hurt in a car crash, so that feeling motivates us to buckle up. Michael Singer says if you want to see why you do something, then don’t do it and see what happens.

Maybe it's as simple as accepting reality (present, past, and possible futures) while understanding how the mind works to free ourselves from unnecessary desires (products of conditioning) that disturb our peace.

Dwayne, “The Disliker,” exists, and I can’t dislike that fact. It makes sense (to me) to look at its dislikes rather than ignoring them.

It’s like owing taxes and getting upset every time I throw a past-due notice in the trash without opening it. Nothing is changing. I have more upset ahead.

I gotta do whatever makes sense. Work to pay the bill, or don’t, but disliking it upsets me.

Two options: work to eliminate the dislike, or continue to get upset.

How to eliminate the dislike:
- Why does my mind judge this outcome as bad?
- Why is it not actually bad? (we have to see it’s not true or we will continue to believe it.)
- Acknowledge that I’m stuck right now because I can’t see through it. I can’t dislike that my mind dislikes something, or that’s just more unhappiness.

- reality includes the person’s own programming (biology + conditioning), so we can’t dislike that either.
- The mind dropping its dislike of reality will allow it to settle, and logical realizations can more easily occur.

You’re not present, and this mental story is what sucks. This is the state of the world, and your mind’s dissatisfaction upsets you. You don’t want to be emotionally attached to an outcome, so go with the flow. Do you need a nap?


Do you want to be happy? Yeah, we all do, right? What causes unhappiness? Simply stated, we feel discontent when bad stuff happens. Further compounding our troubles, unhealthy negative feelings hinder our ability to think clearly, so we end up causing ourselves even more difficulties by damaging relationships, for example. To eradicate it, we will first need to clearly understand its cause.

To prevent unhappiness we just need to avoid bad stuff then, right? Exactly! However, there’s only one way to guarantee you’ll always get what you want, and that’s to want what is. Reality is what happened or could happen. You must want reality to be exactly as it is. We can’t dislike any of it!

I can hear you saying, “I dislike public speaking, so I don’t want to do it.” That’s fine; that's how our minds work. So, if you dislike public speaking, it makes total sense to try to avoid it. What we’re talking about here is having zero dislike that your boss said you’ll be giving a talk at the next large conference. We’ll get into this more in a bit.

By judging outcomes, our mind makes them good or bad on a scale from the best good to the worst bad, with indifference in the middle. This primarily subconscious calculation is affected by moods and based on previous experiences of good and bad feelings. It’s easy to see how feelings motivate us to act. We naturally move away from the bad toward the good.

For example, do you want this pile of money? What if you have to rob a bank to get it? Your mind likely saw it as good initially, but now as bad. The value is assigned to the outcome based on all available factors. (Include pimple example below?)

Do you see how the mind creates its reality. If you like something that happened, is there a problem? It’s all fine and good until we’re upset because the outcome was bad, according to our mind’s perspective. We didn’t get what we wanted, and the more we dislike that, the worse we feel. There’s objective reality, where good and bad don’t exist, and then there’s our mind’s judgment, which determines our emotional state. Our minds need to realize this causal connection even though it doesn’t immediately solve unhappiness.

Of course, no one wants people to be rude or the internet not to work, but these things happen, so preference is all they are. People are rude sometimes, and the internet will stop working at some point. That’s reality. It’s the world in which we live! Eliminating dislikes solves unhappiness by definition because we’re not upset unless we dislike something.

It’s why we enjoy compliments and avoid bee stings. Is it bad for the fox to eat the rabbit? No, that’s just reality. However, it’s bad for the rabbit and good for the fox. Do you see the cause and effect relationship?

That’s pretty simple, isn’t it? Clearly understanding unhappiness is the first step, but we still need to eliminate triggers as we experience them.

Eliminating The Triggers
A trigger is our mind’s dislike of something "bad" happening. To eliminate a trigger, we have to see that it’s not actually bad.

How is it not bad if someone scratches my car and I have to pay a bunch of money? It’s hard to imagine how that’s not bad, isn’t it? Next, let’s understand how things happen.

Why We Do What We Do
Our mind conducts a primarily subconscious cost/benefit analysis. If it determines that the benefits outweigh the costs, taking action will seem reasonable.

So, everyone does whatever seems reasonable according to their mind’s reasons, and those are based on the mind’s conditioned value judgments. Understanding this makes it easier to accept (preventing dislike of) other people’s behavior. It’s kind of like not being upset at the tree branch for falling and scratching your car. The branch was weak and the wind was strong, which made the branch fall right where you happened to park your car.

Similar to the tree branch example, someone was mad about what you said at the meeting, so it seemed reasonable in their heightened emotional state to key your car because "payback's a bitch."

Okay, so what? It’s still bad, and we don’t want our cars scratched, right? Well, even if someone did it to be a jerk, we understand they had their reasons. It helps remove the malice because we can see that it had to happened exactly how it happened because of cause and effect.

Since we understand how the mind works, we know it’s the mind’s judgment that makes this event bad. That’s huge because we no longer have to constantly try to control the world to avoid unhappiness.

Now, while we have painful triggers, we want to avoid getting triggered, which makes complete sense. After all, we don’t want to touch a hot stove because we don’t want the pain. However, if we’re going to solve unhappiness, we can’t keep running from our mind’s problems. We’ll start with the small stuff, like traffic, and work up to the big stuff, like death. Triggers are painful, but they’re our way to peace because eliminating them results in peace!

🚨🚨🚨 LEFT OFF HERE

- The Practicing Stoic's chapter 1 one Judgment has many ways to illustrate that it's our judgments that upset us.
- What are outcomes? (examples like even self-concept)
- Expectations lead to disappointment (note: 🤔 not if the expectation becomes reality, but then happiness is out of our control)
- That wished outcomes aren’t entirely up to us, so we may not get what we desire.
- DECISIONS (what should I do?): “What is the cost to get what I want, and am I willing to pay it?”
- Unhappiness is illogical because everything happens according to cause and effect.
- (something like) don’t believe me; see if it’s true for you
- The final answer is always presence 100% of the time. There is no thinking (or dislike?) in the present, which means there is no unhappiness. I think there are probably only a few people who can immediately drop all desires. I was not one of them, so I had to go through the process outlined above.
- It is ALL the mind’s story, and that’s the quick disconnect back to presence once you understand the mind.
- It’s so relaxing being released from desire’s grip.
- Thinking about stuff is fine, but understand the cost. You’re giving up the present moment to play in a fantasy. Are you okay with that? Then do it!
- Take a breath, come back to the present, and then follow the breadcrumbs.
- Don't set your hopes too high
- Dislike is the upset I’m feeling. When I notice it, I ask, “Must I dislike this?” or even “Why can’t I like this?”
- Is a pimple on your face bad? Well, it’s reality. It’s a pimple, and people get pimples. So, why do some minds consider it bad. It’s bad for something, right? If you were on a solo two week camping trip and got a pimple, would it still be bad. It’s likely bad because people will see it…
- if you toss some trash toward the garbage as if you are playing basketball, and you miss, is that bad? Only if it’s a half drinking milkshake. Why would that make it bad? Because you don’t wanna clean up a mess.

Relationships
Imagine telling someone that you’re finding their corny dad jokes to be annoying. You’re likely to be met with defensiveness rather than sympathy. However, if both people understand how the mind works and are working on their triggers, the experience can be a very different and the process of eliminating triggers more efficient.

While your perspective on their jokes may still be a trigger for them, they’re much more likely to understand that you’re stuck with your mind’s perspective, and that it’s causing you unhappiness. Additionally, the joker may consider whether people find their jokes annoying and if it makes sense to continue joking in the same way. This reflection is the mind recalculating the cost/benefit analysis.

Other
Anytime you start getting uptight (disliking reality), it makes sense to take a breath and use logic because you already know the desiring mind is pulling you out of the present and making you upset. “What makes sense to do next?” (breadcrumbs)
