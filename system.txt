Do you want to be happy? Yeah, we all do, right? What causes unhappiness? Simply stated, we feel discontent when bad stuff happens. Further compounding our troubles, unhealthy negative feelings hinder our ability to think clearly, so we end up causing ourselves even more difficulties by damaging relationships, for example. To eradicate it, we will first need to clearly understand its cause.

To prevent unhappiness we just need to avoid bad stuff then, right? Exactly! However, there’s only one way to guarantee you’ll always get what you want, and that’s to want what is. Reality is what happened or could happen. You must want reality to be exactly as it is. We can’t dislike any of it!

I can hear you saying, “I dislike public speaking, so I don’t want to do it.” That’s fine; that's how our minds work. So, if you dislike public speaking, it makes total sense to try to avoid it. What we’re talking about here is having zero dislike that your boss said you’ll be giving a talk at the next large conference. We’ll get into this more in a bit.

By judging outcomes, our mind makes them good or bad on a scale from the best good to the worst bad, with indifference in the middle. This primarily subconscious calculation is affected by moods and based on previous experiences of good and bad feelings. It’s easy to see how feelings motivate us to act. We naturally move away from the bad toward the good.

For example, do you want this pile of money? What if you have to rob a bank to get it? Your mind likely saw it as good initially, but now as bad. The value is assigned to the outcome based on all available factors. (Include pimple example below?)

Do you see how the mind creates its reality. If you like something that happened, is there a problem? It’s all fine and good until we’re upset because the outcome was bad, according to our mind’s perspective. We didn’t get what we wanted, and the more we dislike that, the worse we feel. There’s objective reality, where good and bad don’t exist, and then there’s our mind’s judgment, which determines our emotional state. Our minds need to realize this causal connection even though it doesn’t immediately solve unhappiness.

Of course, no one wants people to be rude or the internet not to work, but these things happen, so preference is all they are. People are rude sometimes, and the internet will stop working at some point. That’s reality. It’s the world in which we live! Eliminating dislikes solves unhappiness by definition because we’re not upset unless we dislike something.

It’s why we enjoy compliments and avoid bee stings. Is it bad for the fox to eat the rabbit? No, that’s just reality. However, it’s bad for the rabbit and good for the fox. Do you see the cause and effect relationship?

That’s pretty simple, isn’t it? Clearly understanding unhappiness is the first step, but we still need to eliminate triggers as we experience them.

Eliminating The Triggers
A trigger is our mind’s dislike of something "bad" happening. To eliminate a trigger, we have to see that it’s not actually bad.

How is it not bad if someone scratches my car and I have to pay a bunch of money? It’s hard to imagine how that’s not bad, isn’t it? Next, let’s understand how things happen.

Why We Do What We Do
Our mind conducts a primarily subconscious cost/benefit analysis. If it determines that the benefits outweigh the costs, taking action will seem reasonable.

So, everyone does whatever seems reasonable according to their mind’s reasons, and those are based on the mind’s conditioned value judgments. Understanding this makes it easier to accept (preventing dislike of) other people’s behavior. It’s kind of like not being upset at the tree branch for falling and scratching your car. The branch was weak and the wind was strong, which made the branch fall right where you happened to park your car.

Similar to the tree branch example, someone was mad about what you said at the meeting, so it seemed reasonable in their heightened emotional state to key your car because "payback's a bitch."

Okay, so what? It’s still bad, and we don’t want our cars scratched, right? Well, even if someone did it to be a jerk, we understand they had their reasons. It helps remove the malice because we can see that it had to happened exactly how it happened because of cause and effect.

Since we understand how the mind works, we know it’s the mind’s judgment that makes this event bad. That’s huge because we no longer have to constantly try to control the world to avoid unhappiness.

Now, while we have painful triggers, we want to avoid getting triggered, which makes complete sense. After all, we don’t want to touch a hot stove because we don’t want the pain. However, if we’re going to solve unhappiness, we can’t keep running from our mind’s problems. We’ll start with the small stuff, like traffic, and work up to the big stuff, like death. Triggers are painful, but they’re our way to peace because eliminating them results in peace!

🚨🚨🚨 LEFT OFF HERE

- What are outcomes? (examples like even self-concept)
- Expectations lead to disappointment (note: 🤔 not if the expectation becomes reality, but then happiness is out of our control)
- That wished outcomes aren’t entirely up to us, so we may not get what we desire.
- DECISIONS (what should I do?): “What is the cost to get what I want, and am I willing to pay it?”
- Unhappiness is illogical because everything happens according to cause and effect.
- (something like) don’t believe me; see if it’s true for you
- The final answer is always presence 100% of the time. There is no thinking (or dislike?) in the present, which means there is no unhappiness. I think there are probably only a few people who can immediately drop all desires. I was not one of them, so I had to go through the process outlined above.
- It is ALL the mind’s story, and that’s the quick disconnect back to presence once you understand the mind.
- It’s so relaxing being released from desire’s grip.
- Thinking about stuff is fine, but understand the cost. You’re giving up the present moment to play in a fantasy. Are you okay with that? Then do it!
- Take a breath, come back to the present, and then follow the breadcrumbs.
- Don't set your hopes too high
- Dislike is the upset I’m feeling. When I notice it, I ask, “Must I dislike this?” or even “Why can’t I like this?”
- Is a pimple on your face bad? Well, it’s reality. It’s a pimple, and people get pimples. So, why do some minds consider it bad. It’s bad for something, right? If you were on a solo two week camping trip and got a pimple, would it still be bad. It’s likely bad because people will see it…
- if you toss some trash toward the garbage as if you are playing basketball, and you miss, is that bad? Only if it’s a half drinking milkshake. Why would that make it bad? Because you don’t wanna clean up a mess.

Relationships
Imagine telling someone that you’re finding their corny dad jokes to be annoying. You’re likely to be met with defensiveness rather than sympathy. However, if both people understand how the mind works and are working on their triggers, the experience can be a very different and the process of eliminating triggers more efficient.

While your perspective on their jokes may still be a trigger for them, they’re much more likely to understand that you’re stuck with your mind’s perspective, and that it’s causing you unhappiness. Additionally, the joker may consider whether people find their jokes annoying and if it makes sense to continue joking in the same way. This reflection is the mind recalculating the cost/benefit analysis.

Other
Anytime you start getting uptight (disliking reality), it makes sense to take a breath and use logic because you already know the desiring mind is pulling you out of the present and making you upset. “What makes sense to do next?” (breadcrumbs)
